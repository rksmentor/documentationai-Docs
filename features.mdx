## Document Creation and Editing Tools

Create new documents quickly using the intuitive editor. Sourcingmentor supports Markdown and MDX, allowing you to embed components like code blocks, tables, and images directly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Document" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your workspace and click the "New Document" button. Choose a template for IT project notes, PHP guides, or blank pages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit with Rich Tools" icon="edit-3">
    Use the visual editor for bold, lists, and links. Switch to Markdown mode for advanced formatting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview and Publish" icon="eye">
    Preview changes live, then publish to make it available to your team.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Here is an example of embedding a code block in your MDX document:

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Example: Fetch project data
  async function getProjectData(id) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/projects/${id}`);
    return response.json();
  }
  ```
  ```python
  # Example: Query database for projects
  import requests
  response = requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/projects/{project_id}")
  data = response.json()
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use keyboard shortcuts like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> for bold and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> for links to speed up editing.
</Callout>

## Version Control and History Tracking

Every change you make is automatically versioned. View the full history, compare versions, and restore previous states without losing work.

<Expandable title="How Version Control Works" default-open="true">
  Sourcingmentor saves snapshots on each edit. Access history via the document menu.

  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      A[Draft 1] --> B[Draft 2]
      B --> C[Published v1.0]
      C --> D[Edit: Fix typo]
      D --> E[Published v1.1]
  ```
</Expandable>

Restore a version in three steps:

1. Open document history.
2. Select the desired version.
3. Click "Restore".

## Collaboration and Sharing Options
